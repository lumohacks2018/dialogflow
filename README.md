Dialogflow chatbot built to converse with those one-degree from veterans and those vulnerable to PTSD.

## Setup

## Prebuilt Agents

The [_Small Talk_ Dialogflow prebuilt agent](https://dialogflow.com/docs/agents/prebuilt-smalltalk) has been imported as a base for this project, to make the bot respond more naturally.
